# Frontend Starter Pack
This repository contains starter code for a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript website.

## Intro
The frontend of a website boils down to 3 components: the structure of the site (HTML), how the site looks (CSS), and how the site functions (Javascript/JS). In this demo, we'll be using pure HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is a compilation of HTML, CSS, JS starting ideas and concepts that you can use for your ZotHacks project or whatever project you want.

## Installation
- No installation is needed! Just drag the HTML file into your browser.
- If you use VSCode, there is a great [extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/) that makes developing frontend apps much easier. Any change you make will be directly reflected in the website instead of you having to drag the HTML file into your browser again.

## Resources
If you've never built a website before, here are a few resources to get you started.
- [What is an API?](https://medium.com/@perrysetgo/what-exactly-is-an-api-69f36968a41f) 
- [How to Make API Requests](https://medium.com/swlh/making-use-of-apis-in-your-front-end-c168e343bea3): Get data using a frontend.
- [HTTP Requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp): How the internet communicates. Whenever you go to a URL or submit a form, there is a request that is sent to get or change information.

If you're feeling more advanced, here are some other resourses to expand your front end knowledge,
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) - CSS library that containing preset styles
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS scripting framework that can potentially give you a more intuitive view on CSS (nested CSS)
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Allow you to structure and space out your elements in pure CSS. You can see this in action when you are using the `display: flex;` styling in your container element.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) - A JavaScript framework that allows you to build your website using the idea of components.
