    Animations are one of the more advanced topics in CSS, but they can be simple
    enough to use for your ZotHacks project. The basic idea is that any element has an animation property
    where the animation can be applied to it. The property has 3 main subproperties we will focus on:
    name, duration, iteration. The name of the animation is defined by keyframes, which describes
    all the steps in the animation. Duration is how long each cycle of the animation lasts. Iteration
    is how long you want the animation to repeat.
